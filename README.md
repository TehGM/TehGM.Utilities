This solution contains utility libraries that I created to make features easy to re-use in multiple projects.

### Included Libraries
This project currently contains following libraries:

- [TehGM.Utilities.TimeFormatting](TehGM.Utilities.TimeFormatting) - includes utilities for formatting TimeSpan strings.

More libraries might be added as needed, when needed (by me)... or when I feel like it.

### Requirements
The library targets [.NET Standard 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/standard/net-standard), and therefore works with .NET Core 2.0+, .NET Framework 4.6.1+ and .NET 5+.

### Contributing
In case you want to report a bug or request a new feature, open a new [Issue](https://github.com/TehGM/TehGM.Utilities/issues).

If you want to contribute a patch or update, fork repository, implement the change, and open a pull request.
