This library contains a set of types, wrappers and methods for generating unique IDs beyond standard GUID capabilities.

- **Base64Guid** - a wrapper for .NET Guid, which handles string conversion into trimmed Base64 format. This results in Guid's string representation becoming 22 characters long (as opposed to 36 character GUID).
