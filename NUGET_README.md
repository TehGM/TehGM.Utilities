This solution contains utility libraries that I created to make features easy to re-use in multiple projects.

### Included Libraries
This NuGet package currently contains following libraries:

- ***TehGM.Utilities.UniqueID*** - includes types and methods for generating unique IDs.

More libraries might be added as needed, when needed (by me)... or when I feel like it.

### Source Repository
TehGM.Utilities is open source, with code hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/TehGM/TehGM.Utilities).
